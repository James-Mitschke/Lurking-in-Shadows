Hi there, welcome to my FYP Project game!

In order to play the game, you'll need to run the "Lurking in Shadows.exe" file. The game's options can be changed from the settings menu, and I personally recommend you turn the music right down as it can be quite loud.

No worries if you don't get the audio right before getting into the gameplay, as pressing escape will bring up a menu where you can adjust this.

The controls menu can be found from within the settings menu, and there is a little typo where I mention how to turn on/off the flashlight. The alternate button is left-click, not right click.

Furthermore the game might take a little while to load into the actual gameplay, especially if this is your first time launching the game, so just sit back and relax after clicking new game or continue, as it can take upwards of 10 seconds to load. This is the same in the new-game cutscene at the end.

The objective of the game is to attempt to escape the mansion by reaching the basement, you can do this by collecting keys around the map that will open some unlocked doors. You'll know which doors are locked when you attempt to interact with them, and if you forget which keys you already have, pressing escape will show you on the left side of the pause menu.

Otherwise, for marking purposes the original programming for the game can be seen in the "Build Scripts" folder, I recommend using Visual Studio Code to load these files, however any IDE program should be able to read these, including notepad or notepad ++ if you don't have access to an IDE.

If there are any issues with the files provided please do not hesitate to get in contact with me, as I will be retaining a copy of this project folder with no modifications made past the submission time which should reflect in the properties of the folder.

Otherwise, I hope you enjoy the game, and good luck with your marking!
